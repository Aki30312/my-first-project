This is my first project using Git and GitHub.

- How to link a local project to GitHub
- How to push updates
- How to check logs and differences

## Commands I Used
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
git init
touch my-first-project.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/my-first-project.git
git branch -M main
